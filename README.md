"# Simple_Calculator" 

Hello guys,

	In this project, I designed a simple calculator for you. Let me tell you simply about using the calculator.



	The project is displayed with a simple panel. There are some keys at the bottom of the panel and by clicking these keys, necessary actions are taken. In keying, the Rad and Deg keys allow the calculator to work in radian and degree modes. The EXP key provides a 10-digit number to be added next to the number. Ans key makes the previous result reflected on the panel. The 'e' and pi signs allow you to add constants to the screen. AC key provides display port reset. The equals key allows you to press the result on the screen.




Each operation you want to do is indicated on the left of the panel. In this way, it is aimed to get rid of the transaction confusion. I made the project simple. I would like to make it complex in the future, but for now I did not want to dwell on it too much. I wish you to improve as much as you want to improve.
